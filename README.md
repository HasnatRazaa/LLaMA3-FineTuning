# 🧠 LLaMA 3 Fine-Tuning for Medical Q&A using Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Welcome to **llama3-medical-cot-finetune** — a robust and scalable implementation for fine-tuning **Meta’s LLaMA 3** model on **medical question-answering tasks**, powered by **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning. This project blends domain knowledge with cutting-edge NLP techniques to build smarter, context-aware medical AI.
